    <p>These lemon cheesecake creme brulee croissants are filled with a mixture of lemon curd and no-bake lemon cheesecake filling, then glazed with caramelized sugar syrup for that creme brulee crunch.</p>
    <p>They are then topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar and a hint of lemon zest for an extra burst of citrus flavor. The croissants are baked to a golden perfection, ensuring a crisp, flaky exterior that complements the creamy, tangy filling. Perfect for a decadent breakfast treat or an indulgent dessert, these croissants are a delightful fusion of classic French pastry and modern flavors. Serve them slightly warm for the best experience, allowing the filling to melt in your mouth with every bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large croissants</li>
        <li>1 cup cheesecake filling, such as PhiladelphiaÂ® Cheesecake No-Bake</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon curd</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cheesecake filling, lemon curd and lemon zest in a bowl; stir well. Add mixture to a piping bag or large zip-top bag. Make a small cut in the corner of the bag.</li>
        <li>Use a paring knife to make a small cut into the side of each croissant. Create an opening large enough to pipe the filling into. Fill each roll with about 3 tablespoons of  filling. Place filled croissants on a wire rack set inside a lined baking sheet to catch excess drippings. 

        </li>
        <li>Add sugar and water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce to medium low and cook, without stirring, until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove mixture from the heat. Working very carefully, pour sugar syrup evenly over prepared croissants to lightly coat rolls; let stand until completely cooled and lightly hardened on top, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
